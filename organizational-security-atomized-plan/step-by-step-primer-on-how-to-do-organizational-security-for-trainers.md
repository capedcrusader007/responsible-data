I am: a security trainer

##What is this?
This is an atomized security plan for organizational security. It is meant to be used to supplement security trainers planning process for supporting organizations who are interested in incrementally improving their security practices.

##Steps to get to an action plan
1.First, understand your capabilities. Do not overstate what you are capable of, and rely on others in the community to help you when your skills don't match a particular need.
2.Identify the organization that you would like to work with, needs your assistance, won't be harmed by your intervention, and that the opportunity cost of working with another organization is not too high.
3.Understand the organization's information ecosystem and identify 3 staff people that can give you the right levels of detail in how the organization creates, shares, and uses information.
4.As you ask questions and learn more, be looking for types of people within the organization who can help you roll out approaches, advocate for better practices, and work with you to be successful.
5.Ask the organization, without bias (from you), what are your threats. Don't lead them straight to digital, because there are often other threats that have nothing to do with digital tools.
6.Ask a few people within the organization to independently give you their view of the top 10 threats to the organization. Average those results out and see if you know how to support them to address their major threats.
7.If you don't, find another trainer that can help them.
8.Dive deeper and through questions and conversations to better understand the threats that the organization is actually facing.
9.Determine the most critical mitigation approaches that you should consider in your support.
10.Confirm this approach with internal organizational actors that will be responsible for leading, permitting, or supporting the security process.
11.Delicately advocate to and hand hold high level staff so they feel empowered and like the decision to work on security came from them. You might not always be the best person to do this. Find allies who can do this well.
12.Ask the organization what experiences and expertise they have in addressing threats (generally, and specifically related to the threats you have surfaced).
13.Confirm and test the knowledge and digital literacy levels of staff. [INSERT SURVEY]
14.Identify reasonable goals for the organization that they agree with.
15.Compare that organization with other organizations that are similar in country, regionally, and across issue areas.
16.Compare how other organizations who have addressed threats – to avoid duplication of work and planning – if it has worked for someone else, consider adopting that approach.
17.Determine how long an action plan should be for, and what follow-up intervention support you have to provide.
18.Find your strongest ally whose capacities you can build over time so they can take over your work once you move the organization to a more sustainable security situation.
19.Build momentum and buy-in for the process that is about to start. Presentation, awareness raising, real case studies, reaffirm that you are in fact a sensible human who wants to balance security and productivity.
20.Set specific objectives that outline the BIG TASK, little tasks, and timeline. Communicate the tasks and expectations of staff members within the organization in a way that is easy for them to plan in the short-term to participate in. Understand your options for leverage if things are not completed on time, or if the organization has 'too busy' syndrome.
21.Be flexible if new information, threats, opportunities, risk, events, tools, approaches, make themselves known.
22.Use your action plan and the to-do lists in this spreadsheet (add more, and send them to us when you add them) to sequence tasks in a work plan that the organization can use to track its progress, and providing audible trail.
23.Contribute your organizational security training experiences to other trainers.
