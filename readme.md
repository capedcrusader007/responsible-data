#Responsible Data Forum
##[responsibledata.io](https://responsibledata.io)

The Responsible Data Forum is a series of collaborative events, co-organized by [Aspiration](https://aspirationtech.org/) and [the engine room](https://www.theengineroom.org/), and convened to develop useful tools and strategies for dealing with the ethical, security and privacy challenges facing data-driven advocacy.

This Github repository collects and organizes all the outputs from the responsible data forums.

**Please feel free to fork, edit, share, and use these documents.** 

They are designed to be used by advocacy teams and hosting providers who are looking to make more informed and responsible decisions about selecting hosting providers. For more on responsible data work with the engine room and partners, please visit [responsibledata.io](https://responsibledata.io).
