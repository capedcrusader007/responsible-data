##Creating a Response Guide for Online Attacks
*This should be an introductory paragraph outlining what this is about, why it is useful and who it addresses.*

##Kinds of Attackers
* Generic automated
* Targeted
* Accidental Disclosure

##Policy
* Have a process in place in advance - having a policy after you've been hacked is useless
* Establish a tech contact, or set aside resources to outsource help
* Response time
* Dictated by severity of disclosure but should be ASAP
* 1/2 of threat time - minimum
* make this known to users, mail, social media, blog post, etc.
* Know your level of data sensitivity - perhaps data does not need to be online?
* If attack reoccurs, seek external help
* Have in place a threshold for when you are no longer able to host the data 
##Establishing the Problem
* Contact Technical person
* Hoster
* External Party
* Try to outline impact in a worst case scenario
* Find recently modified files
* Is there anything to indicate that the attacker was targeting you specifically
* Have users received unusual communications (social engineering/phishing)
* If there is a specific user that was causing the problem, notify them, establish if they did anything unusual, etc.
* Kind of attack?
* Sending spam - most likely generic
* Hosting unusual files - usually generic attack
* Copyrighted material
* Viruses
* Other exploit code
* Defacement could be both kinds of attack
* Could be a generic attacker marking territory
* Could be a targeted attack to discredit site operators
* Subtle changes to content- both kinds of attack
* Pages looking strange
* Content being loaded from outside pages
* site offline due to DDoS - usually targeted
* Unusual logins/ account activity
* Logins from countries that user is not in
* Accounts that were previously inactive becoming very active 
#Informing Users
* ASAP!
* Transparency is the key to re-establishing trust
* Warn of recurrence if appropriate
* Inform users via many mediums
* mail, social media, blog post, phone (if appropriate)
* provide regular updates on progress
* final postmortem, report on what happened, what steps you have taken to address the problem, what policy changes, etc.
* steps for users to take
* provide additional, educational advice
* Issue an apology, unconditional, and attempt to reestablish trust. 
##Mitigation
* Change passwords
* If possible, get a security audit
* if not possible, get a technical review of server and site setup
* Audit user lists
* If user reports fishing activity, issue a general warning to all users
* If user is sending suspicious emails, inform them through another medium, as well as e-mail

> If you can't get outside assistance, update everything: CMS plug-ins and other software.

##In cases of accidental disclosure
* Rehide the content
* Remove content from caches
*  for all search engines
*  Google
*  Bing
*  Yahoo
*  More...
*  Google takes about 10 minutes
* (Add a disallow rule in robots.txt entry for content)
* Contact all users, educate on how not to disclose information, avoid reoccurance

##Examples!
* Reactions to Heartbleed - generally positive reactions, such as Heroku.
* Yahoo was vulnerable for 36 hours, not acceptable.
